                 The working principle of Selenium.
Selenium follows a client-server architecture based on the JSON Wire Protocol W3C WebDriver protocol
It allows communication between:
* Your test script (client)
* WebDriver (browser driver)
* Actual Browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

Test Script
automation code in languages like:
* Java
* Python
* C#
* JavaScript
This script uses Selenium libraries (WebDriver API) to send commands such as:
* driver.get("URL")
* driver.findElement()
* element.click()

WebDriver
* ChromeDriver
* GeckoDriver (Firefox)
* EdgeDriver
| Your Code → WebDriver → Browser |

WebDriver Works:
 Listens on a port (e.g., localhost:9515)
 Accepts JSON commands
 Executes them in the browser
 Returns responses back to your test script

Browser Layer

The browser exposes a native automation interface.
The driver uses this interface to:
* Open pages
* Click elements
* Read values
* Run JavaScript
* Take screenshots
Everything happens as if a real user is interacting.


Response Back to Your Test Script
After executing the command, the browser sends the result back to the driver, which sends it to your script.
Example:
Command: element.click()
Response: "status": 0 (success)
